# Contributing

This repo follows the ParkviewLab conventions. The essentials are below; the
authoritative, org-wide version of all of this is the
[ParkviewLab handbook](https://github.com/ParkviewLab/handbook).

## Branch & PR flow

- Branch off **`develop`** into an ephemeral worktree named with a prefix:
  `feature-`, `bug-`/`fix-`, `doc-`, `test-`, `ops-`, `ci-`, `build-`, `release-`
  (hyphen, not slash). See the handbook's `branching.md`.
- Open a PR into **`develop`**. The repo is **squash-only**, so the merge button
  can only squash; **merging is the maintainer's action.**
- Releases are cut from **`main`** via the CLI (`git merge --no-ff develop`, then
  bump + tag), not a PR. See the handbook's `releases.md`.

## Commit / PR-title convention (this is what the changelog reads)

Because PRs are squash-merged, **the PR title becomes the commit subject**, and
the changelog is generated from it (via [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/) +
`cliff.toml`). Prefix every PR title with a [Conventional
Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) type:

| Prefix | CHANGELOG section | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `feat:` | Features | user-visible |
| `fix:` | Bug fixes | user-visible |
| `perf:` | Performance | user-visible |
| `refactor:` | Refactor | |
| `docs:` | Docs | |
| `test:` | Tests | |
| `chore:` / `ci:` / `build:` / `style:` | _(dropped)_ | stays in git history, not surfaced |

A PR title without a recognised prefix is **silently dropped** from the
changelog. So: prefix it.

## Local checks before opening a PR

Run the same checks CI requires, so the PR is green on arrival. Until the Cargo
workspace exists, only the REUSE lint applies.

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
uvx --from "reuse[charset-normalizer]" reuse lint
```

A PR **can't be merged until the required checks pass** (format, clippy, tests,
REUSE, the version guard; see the handbook's `ci.md`). Push after each commit.

## Versioning

The version lives in **`Cargo.toml` only**, as the workspace's package version;
never hard-code it elsewhere, and never type it on a `git tag` line. Use
`git bump` / `git release` from
[`dev-tools`](https://github.com/ParkviewLab/dev-tools); see the handbook's
`releases.md`. (The helpers do not yet read a `Cargo.toml`; see
[`in-flight_ideas.md`](in-flight_ideas.md).)

## AI contributors

Read `docs/northstar.md` first, and follow the behavioural contract in the
handbook's `ai-collaboration.md` (notably: merging, tagging, and releasing each
need an explicit, per-action go-ahead).
